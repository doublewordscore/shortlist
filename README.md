# shortlist - list/task editor

Primitive list/task editor that allows a user to create a list, add items, remove items, and check off the completion of the task.

In this example, I made a list of movies.

Future planning:
  1.  Add functionality to add a rating for each task
  2.  Print lists containing only completed tasks or only uncompleted tasks
  3.  Functionality to change the order of the list
